Hi Good day!
I'm Kenneth, I am an aspiring software engineer

I deploy my beta-portfolio since it is still under developing stage.
Step by step I am trying to learn the frontend development and in the long run seeing myself to be a Full Stack Developer.

You can do chat or message me through my email for your suggestions and feedback.

THANK YOU!
